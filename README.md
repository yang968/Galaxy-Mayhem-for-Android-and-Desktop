# Galaxy-Mayhem-for-Android-and-Desktop
This is my first Java project using the LibGdx Framework. I created this project in March 2014 and finished it in July 2014. This version of code is updated to disable Google Play Game Services and just to show my coding implementation. LibGdx allows users to create games and export to various platforms. For more information please check : https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/

The code will be updated frequently with comments, refactored variables, and explanations of LibGdx elements.
The original name for the game was Space Havoc and thus you will see some packages in com.shy.spacehavoc format

If you wish to download and play the game, feel free to do so.
